## Hi there, I am Chris 👋

I am interested in linking structural/wind engineering with computational methods such as CFD to improve efficiency and optimize designs.
I enjoy teaching others to leverage the computational tools that are openly available to them in order to improve their workflows.

### Flow Visualization
The following images are generating using a custom analysis pipeline which combines OpenFOAM, Paraview, and Blender.

The following gif shows the streamline progression around the building.

### Aerodynamic Optimization
A comparison of the flow around a square building and a building optimized to reduce the drag force. The custom optimization workflow uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) surrogate model coupled with a Genetic Algorithm to deterine the optimal shape.
